    "Q1. Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by creating multiple bootstrap samples of the training data and training individual decision trees on each sample. Each tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, introducing variability. By averaging the predictions of these trees during inference, bagging reduces the impact of individual noisy or overfit trees, leading to better generalization performance.\n",

    "Q2. Advantages and disadvantages of using different types of base learners in bagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: Using different types of base learners in bagging can increase the diversity of the ensemble, leading to improved performance. Different learners may capture different aspects of the data or have different strengths in handling certain patterns or relationships. This diversity can enhance the ensemble's ability to generalize well.\n",
    "Disadvantages: If the base learners are too similar or highly correlated, it can limit the diversity of the ensemble and reduce its effectiveness. Additionally, using more complex base learners may increase the computational cost and training time of the ensemble.\n",
    "Q3. The choice of base learner can affect the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging. In general, base learners with low bias and high variance, such as deep decision trees, can benefit from bagging. Bagging reduces the variance of these models, improving their generalization performance. However, if the base learner has low variance and low bias, such as shallow decision trees, bagging may not provide substantial improvements and may even introduce unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Bagging can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The main difference lies in the aggregation of predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: In classification tasks, the ensemble's final prediction can be determined by majority voting. Each base learner predicts the class label, and the class with the most votes is chosen as the final prediction.\n",
    "Regression: In regression tasks, the ensemble's final prediction is typically the average or the median of the predictions from the base learners. The continuous predictions from individual models are averaged to obtain the final regression estimate.\n",
    "Q5. The ensemble size in bagging refers to the number of base learners included in the ensemble. The choice of ensemble size depends on the specific problem and the tradeoff between performance and computational resources. In practice, increasing the ensemble size tends to improve performance initially, but there may be diminishing returns beyond a certain point. It is common to use tens or hundreds of base learners in a bagging ensemble, but the exact number should be determined through experimentation or cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. One real-world application of bagging in machine learning is in the field of medical diagnosis. Bagging can be applied to ensemble multiple decision tree models to diagnose diseases based on patient symptoms and medical test results. By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees trained on different bootstrap samples, the ensemble can provide more reliable and accurate diagnoses. The diversity among the base learners helps in capturing various patterns and improving the overall diagnostic performance.\n",
