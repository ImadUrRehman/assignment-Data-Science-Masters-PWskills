    "\n",
    "Train and Export the Model: Train a machine learning model using appropriate algorithms and the available dataset. Once trained, export the model in a suitable format (e.g., serialized object, PMML, ONNX) that can be used for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backend Integration: Set up a backend server that hosts the machine learning model and exposes an API endpoint for making predictions. The backend can be developed using frameworks like Flask, Django, or Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Development: Implement an API endpoint in the backend server that receives the necessary input data for the model (e.g., satellite images, weather data) and returns the predictions. Ensure the API endpoint handles the necessary data preprocessing and invokes the machine learning model for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frontend Integration: In the frontend code of the web application, make HTTP requests to the API endpoint using technologies like JavaScript's Fetch API or libraries like Axios. Pass the required input data to the API and handle the response to display the predictions on the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time or Batch Processing: Determine if the integration requires real-time predictions or batch processing. Real-time processing involves making API requests on user interaction, while batch processing may involve uploading a batch of data for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs or Libraries: Depending on the machine learning framework and tools used, you can utilize APIs or libraries like TensorFlow.js, scikit-learn, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers to load the trained model and perform inference in the backend.\n",
