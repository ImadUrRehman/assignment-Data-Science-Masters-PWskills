    "Missing values in a dataset refer to the absence of data points in one or more attributes of an observation. There can be various reasons for missing values, including data entry errors, incomplete surveys, and non-response bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values is essential because they can lead to biased or incomplete results in statistical analyses, machine learning models, and decision-making processes. If not handled properly, missing values can affect the accuracy and reliability of these processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms that are not affected by missing values include decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and random forests. These algorithms either impute the missing values or ignore them entirely during training and prediction. However, some algorithms such as linear regression and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) can be affected by missing values and require imputation techniques to handle them effectively."

    "Q3. Imbalanced data refers to a situation where the distribution of classes in a classification problem is unequal. This means that one class has a significantly larger number of samples than the other class. If imbalanced data is not handled, the model may be biased towards the majority class and have poor performance on the minority class. For example, in a binary classification problem where the positive class is the minority, the model may have high accuracy due to predicting all samples as the majority class, but it fails to identify the minority class, which is the actual target."

    "For example, if we have a dataset with 100 samples, where 90 samples belong to the majority class and 10 samples belong to the minority class, we can up-sample the minority class by randomly duplicating some samples to create a balanced dataset. Conversely, we can down-sample the majority class by randomly removing some samples to achieve the same balance.\n",

Down-sampling is useful when the majority class is too dominant, and its over-representation may lead to poor model performance on the minority class."
