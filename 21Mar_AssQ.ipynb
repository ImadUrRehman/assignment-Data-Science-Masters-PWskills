    "Q1. The main difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding is that ordinal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category based on its order or rank, whereas label encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category without any specific order. For example, in ordinal encoding, the categories \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2 respectively, whereas in label encoding, they might be encoded as 2, 1, and 0.\n",
    "You might choose ordinal encoding over label encoding when there is a natural order or hierarchy among the categories, such as in the case of \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" in the example above. On the other hand, you might choose label encoding when there is no natural order among the categories."

    "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for encoding categorical variables by mapping each category to a number based on its relation to the target variable. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"city\" and a binary target variable \"is_cool\", we can encode each city by calculating the mean of the target variable for each city, and then ordering the cities based on this mean value.\n",
