    "### Q1.What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a collection of structured data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of information.\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use a tabular schema to store data. The data is organized into tables, with each table representing a different type of object or data entity. SQL databases use SQL as their query language to interact with the data. SQL is a standardized language that is used to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. SQL databases are generally considered to be good for applications that require complex queries or transactions, as well as for applications that require strong data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use a tabular schema. Instead, they use a variety of different data models, such as key-value, document-based, or graph-based. NoSQL databases are designed to be flexible and scalable, making them ideal for applications that require large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases use a variety of different query languages, depending on the specific data model used. They are generally considered to be better for applications that require high scalability and performance, but may sacrifice some data consistency or durability in exchange.\n",

    "\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational database design that help to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or combination of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row of data in that table. The primary key constraint ensures that each value in the primary key column(s) is unique and not null. A primary key is used to ensure data integrity and to help establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or combination of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between two tables, allowing data to be retrieved from multiple tables based on a common column or set of columns. The foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table or are null."
