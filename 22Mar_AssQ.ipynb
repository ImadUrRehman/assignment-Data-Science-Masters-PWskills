    "A2. To calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level, we need to first rank the data for each variable separately, with the lowest value assigned a rank of 1 and the highest value assigned the highest rank. Then we can calculate the difference in ranks for each individual between the two variables, and use a statistical program to compute the correlation coefficient. The resulting coefficient will also be a value between -1 and 1, with the same interpretations as for the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",

    "If the Spearman's rank correlation between the amount of sleep and job satisfaction is, for example, -0.6, this would indicate a strong negative monotonic relationship between the two variables. In other words, individuals who get less sleep tend to report lower levels of job satisfaction, and those who get more sleep tend to report higher levels of job satisfaction. Unlike the Pearson correlation coefficient, the Spearman's rank correlation does not assume that the relationship between the two variables is linear, but only that it is monotonic."

However, the interpretation of the coefficients would depend on the specific values obtained from the dataset, and it's important to assess the significance of the coefficients and the assumptions underlying the calculations."
