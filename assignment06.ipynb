Encapsulation refers to enclosing data and behavior within an object, abstraction simplifies complex objects, inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, and polymorphism allows objects to take on multiple forms."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a new class is created by inheriting the properties and behavior of an existing class, called the base or parent class. The new class is known as the derived or child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of inheritance in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class inherits the properties and behavior of a single base class. For example, a \"Square\" class can inherit from a \"Rectangle\" class which has properties for width and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a derived class inherits the properties and behavior of multiple base classes. For example, a \"Student\" class can inherit from both \"Person\" and \"Employee\" classes which have properties for personal details and employment details respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a derived class inherits the properties and behavior of a base class, which in turn is derived from another base class. For example, a \"Grandson\" class can inherit from a \"Son\" class, which in turn inherits from a \"Father\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit the properties and behavior of a single base class. For example, a \"Car\" class can be inherited by both \"Sedan\" and \"SUV\" classes which have additional properties and behavior specific to their respective types"
